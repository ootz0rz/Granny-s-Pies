			<h2>Assignment Description:</h2>


			<p>
				This assignment tests your understanding of basic XHTML and CSS.  You will 
				create several files related to a recipe web site for a fictional pie company 
				named Granny's Pies.  Write the following files:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><code>index.html</code>, the first of two web pages (with an optional CSS style sheet file)</li>
				<li><code>pie.html</code>, the second of two web pages</li>
				<li><code>recipe.css</code>, the style sheet for <code>pie.html</code></li>

			</ul>

			<p>
				The first part of your task is to create a front page for this web site, stored in a 
				file named <code>index.html</code>.  Your front page must contain a link to 
				<code>pie.html</code>.  The file must also be at least 20 lines long and must 
				contain at least 4 different XHTML elements in its body.  It also may not significantly 
				borrow content from your <code>pie.html</code>.  Otherwise, this front page can 
				have any appearance you like.  If you like, you may use an optional 
				CSS stylesheet with this page named <code>index.css</code> and submit it with your 
				other files.  Be creative!
			</p>

			<p>
				The second (and more substantial) part of the assignment is to recreate a specific 
				web page describing a recipe for lemon meringue pie, stored in a file 
				named <code>pie.html</code>.  Unlike <code>index.html</code>, this page is 
				rigidly specified and must exactly match the appearance specified in this document.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				For full credit, your page must match several stylistic 
				guidelines, all specified later in this document.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="expectedappearance">
			<h2>Expected Appearance:</h2>

			<p>
				You must match in appearance the following pie web page (between but not including the 
				thick black lines).  The width of the screenshot below is based on a browser window width of 1024px; 
				if your screen is a different size, the width of your page may not exactly match.  
				Any line breaks are done automatically by the browser, except ones that are clearly much 
				narrower than the page width, such as the line "One 9-inch pie":

			</ul>

		<div id="behaviordetails">
			<h2>Appearance and Behavior Details:</h2>

			<p>
				All headings on the page should use a foreground color of (red=164, green=164, blue=0) 
				or <code>#A4A400</code> and a background color of (red=240, green=240, blue=240) 
				or <code>#F0F0F0</code>.  The font families for headings are Century Gothic, Futura, Verdana, 
				or any sans-serif font available on the system.  The page's main heading is aligned to the center 
				of the page body, and uses a 24pt bold font.  Other headings on the page are left-aligned and appear 
				in an 20pt normal font.  All headings should be underlined.
			</p>

			<p>
				The overall page's body should have a white background.  Text in the body should have a 
				foreground color of (red=64, green=64, blue=64) or <code>#404040</code> and 
				use an 12pt font.  The font families for page text are Georgia, Garamond, or any serif font 
				available on the system.  Any links on the page should use the color (red=164, green=164, blue=0) 
				or <code>#A4A400</code>, matching the color of the page headings.
			</p>

			<p>
				The names of the four major steps of the recipe directions (such as "Preheat Oven") 
				are formatted in a strong font.  The quotations from the users appear in an italic font as indented 
				blocks with background color (red=255, green=255, blue=200) or <code>#FFFFC8</code>.  The picture 
				of the pie on the page and the W3C validator images at the bottom come from the following 
				image files, respectively:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><span class="url">http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse190m/09sp/homework/1/pie.jpg</span>
				 <br>(use an absolute URL to link to this image; don't link to a relative URL on your hard drive)</li>

				<li><span class="url">http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml11</span></li>
				<li><span class="url">http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss</span></li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The bottom of the page has four links.  The "Home" link should link to your 
				<code>index.html</code> page.  Use a relative URL and assume it is located on the same 
				web site as <code>pie.html</code> in the same directory.  The "Search for other 
				lemon meringue pie recipes" text, the "W3C XHTML 1.1" button, and the "W3C CSS" button should 
				link to the following web pages, respectively:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><span class="url">http://www.google.com/search?q=lemon+meringue+pie+recipe&amp;start=10</span></li>
				<li><span class="url">http://validator.w3.org/check/referer</span></li>
				<li><span class="url">http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer</span></li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>Important:</strong> The XHTML and CSS validator services require your web page to be hosted on a publicly accesible
				server.  On the CDF facility, only the shared servers, such as greywolf and redwolf, have public IP addresses.  Thus, while 
				you may do most of your development on any CDF workstation, make sure that you run your site on one of the public 
				servers to test	the XHMTL and CSS validation feature.   Instructions for runing Apache on CDF 
				are available <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delara/courses/csc309/guide/apache.html">here</a>.
				
			</p>
		

			<p>

				The pie web page's title text should be <strong>Grandma's Lemon Meringue Pie</strong> .
			</p>
		</div>


		<div id="forcsemajors">
			<h2>Extra Features:</h2>

			<p>
				In addition to the previous required features, you must also <strong>complete all of the 
				following additional requirements</strong> in your pie page.  
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Background</strong>: Set the overall page to use a background 
					image of <span class="url">http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse190m/09sp/homework/1/silverware.jpg</span> 
					(use absolute URLs to link to all images).  The image should repeat in both directions across the page 
					and should not move when the page is scrolled.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Favicon</strong>: Set the page to have a "favorites icon" ("favicon") 
					of <span class="url">http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse190m/09sp/homework/1/pie<span class="correction">_</span>icon.gif</span> (use absolute URLs to link to all images).  Instructions for favicons are found in Chapter 3 of the textbook.  The favicon will not work properly in Internet Explorer; you may ignore this.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Pie bullet</strong>: Set all bulleted lists of items on the page to use an image for their bullet icon rather than the normal black circle.  Use the image of <span class="url">http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse190m/09sp/homework/1/pie_icon.gif</span> (use absolute URLs to link to all images).
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>
				As much as possible, you should implement these changes by modifying your CSS code rather than your HTML.  
				Some of the CSS properties necessary will not have been covered in class, so you must learn them yourself.  
				Try using the textbook, Google, or looking at a CSS property reference such as the following site:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a class="url" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_reference.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_reference.asp</a></li>

			</ul>
		</div>


		<div id="implementationandgrading">
			<h2>Implementation and Grading:</h2>

			<p>
				Implement your <code>pie.html</code> web page using XHTML 1.1 as taught in class.  
				For full credit, your page must successfully pass the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C 
				XHTML 1.1 validator</a> with no errors (a <span style="color: green">green</span> bar).  (It is okay 
				if the validator says your page is "tentatively" valid or has warnings, as long as you see 
				the green "Valid" bar in the validator.)  You should choose appropriate HTML tags to match 
				the structure of the content being displayed on the page.  Do not express stylistic information in 
				the HTML page itself, such as inline styles or presentational HTML tags such as <code>b</code> 
				or <code>font</code>.  You may not use HTML tables in your pie recipe page.
			</p>

			
			<p>
				You only need to worry about the appearance of your page in Firefox.  Your pages will not be tested other browsers.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Express all stylistic information on the page using CSS defined in <code>recipe.css</code>.  
				For full credit, your style sheet must successfully pass the <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3C 
				CSS validator</a>.  Part of your grade comes from expressing your CSS concisely and without unnecessary or 
				redundant styles.  
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
				Put all necessary files in one directory, and archive the directory into a single file using tar or a 
			 	similar utility. Finally, submit your assignment using the BlackBoard system.
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
				<strong>Please do not place a solution to this assignment online on a publicly accessible web site.</strong>
